## 📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)

### **1. Nine Pillars Understanding**

- Question: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

   ANS: For better architect system we are using gemini CLi because it make our work more creative and fast .jo kambuht time taking hota hy wo CLi k sath jalsi ho skta hy or hum srf code nahe likh rahy hoty bal k pura system smj ry hoty hy.


- Question: Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer.

   ANS: Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development my wo sari important skills define hy jo k hmy M-shaped developer bnati hy.Isme coding skills, architecture thinking, AI integration, testing, deployment, data management, security, collaboration, aur problem solving aata hai.agr hum ye sb sekh lay to hum complex design system manage kr skty hy.

### **2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development**

- Question:Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

   ANS:Vibe coding my hum "just code krty hy such smj k ni likhty" its like copy andpaste. jo k easy to hy but smjhny k lye mushkil hy agr hum kahi stuck ho jye to kuch smj ni ata or sb mass up ho jta hy.jo k problem create kr deta hy.

- Question:How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

   ANS:Specification-driven coding may phely hum plan bnaty hy structure define krty hy phr us py kam krty hy sb kuch clear and understood hota hy is lye us my problem km face krni prti hy agr stuck ho bi jaye to easily solve kr skty hy.

### **3. Architecture Thinking**

- Question:How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

   ANS:developer srf code ni likhty bal k system ka blueprint bnaty hy.phely suchty hy complet structure kesy connect hoga , konsi layer my kia step follow ho raha hy kia tech use ho ri hy or AI kesi integrate ho raha hy.

- Question:Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

   ANS:Layers aur systems me sochne se code maintainable aur scalable hota hai.jo k easy to use and changable hota hy. Agar sab sirf raw code me hoga, future me changes aur bugs handle karna mushkil ho jata hai.

## 📁 Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)

### Task:
- Using any AI CLI tool, generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.

**Prompt**

```
Generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function in Python. 
The function must check that the email contains "@" and a valid domain like ".com" or ".org". 
It should return clear error messages if the email is invalid. 
Write it in plain English.

```

**The 1-paragraph specification generated by the CLI**
```
✦ The email validation function, to be implemented in Python, will accept a string representing an email address as input. Its primary purpose is to verify  
  the structural validity of the email, ensuring it contains a single "@" symbol separating the local part from the domain, and that the domain includes a   
  top-level domain (TLD) such as ".com" or ".org". The function will return a boolean indicating validity and, if invalid, a descriptive string explaining  ▄  the specific reason for failure (e.g., "Missing @ symbol", "Invalid domain format", "Unsupported TLD"). This specification focuses on basic structural    █  checks rather than comprehensive RFC compliance.
